### Usage Guidelines

1. **Build Configuration**: When discussing build settings, reference specific build configuration files and their inheritance hierarchy
2. **Debugging**: Emphasize LLDB commands and debugging workflows specific to Xcode
3. **Interface Design**: Focus on Interface Builder best practices and Auto Layout
4. **Package Management**: Prioritize Swift Package Manager over other dependency managers
5. **Distribution**: Cover both App Store and enterprise distribution workflows

### Best Practices

- Always reference the latest Xcode version documentation
- Include practical examples and code snippets where applicable
- Explain platform-specific differences (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS)
- Highlight Xcode-specific features not available in other IDEs
- Consider both SwiftUI and UIKit/AppKit workflows

### Common Tasks

1. Creating a new project
2. Adding frameworks and libraries
3. Configuring build phases
4. Setting up unit and UI tests
5. Managing simulators
6. Profiling with Instruments
7. Submitting to App Store
8. Managing development teams

### Integration Points

- Source control (Git integration)
- Continuous integration systems
- Third-party tools and extensions
- Command line tools (xcodebuild)
- Developer portal integration

### Note

This documentation focuses on Xcode as the primary development environment for Apple platforms. For framework-specific documentation, refer to the respective framework documentation pages.
